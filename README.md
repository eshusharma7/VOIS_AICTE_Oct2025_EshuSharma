VOIS AICTE Project – October 2025

This repository contains the source code and implementation for the VOIS–AICTE October 2025 project by Eshu Sharma. The project is developed as part of the AICTE internship program and demonstrates practical applications of Python programming, data analysis, and problem-solving using Jupyter Notebook.
📂 Project Structure
Eshu_Sharma_Source_code.ipynb – Main Jupyter Notebook with source code and outputs.

Datasets / Input Files (if any) – Used for analysis and testing.

Outputs – Results, visualizations, and processed data generated from the notebook.

🚀 Features
1. Well-structured Python code in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Demonstrates concepts like data handling, visualization, and computation.
3. Modular approach to solving tasks step by step.
4. Can be extended for learning, experiments, and real-world use cases.
